+ The random map creator is done
+ The map random populator is unstarted (creatures and objects altogether)
+ Monsters are partially done
+ Collision checker is unstarted
+ Attack is unstarted
+ Inventory is unstarted


1. collision checker
It should go into the Character class.
Two parts: 
 -check for vision (are you in my field of vision?) (done)
 -check for collision (are you standing by me?) (done)

2. Monsters
Rename them to Creatures
Move the attribute parts to Character class (so Player gets them too)
Build the IA framework
 - every character needs an update() method called every turn
 - which IA to load has to be determined at creation time, to reduce processing load
 - every IA is a subclass of a GenericIA class
 - I don't like this, rethink

3. Attacking
Choose a simple battle system, implement the required methods in the Character class

4. Objects
Must create an Object class
Load data from info file (as for Creatures) (syntax to define)

5. Populators
It has to work tightly with Map to implement themes
Each Creature and Object can have percentages of chances of being in a room or in a walkway

6. Inventory
Every character can have an inventory
Size of inventory (as in: number of objects) is unlimited
Capacity is limited though: each Object has an attribute (weight, volume?), there is a limit to the sum of these attributes
You can put something on the invenotry, remove it, use it, wear/yield it, take it off
